# Trendify Frontend

This app lets users play a game where they try and guess the popularity of songs from Spotify. Users can either log in to their spotify to play using their own songs, or they can choose to play with random songs by selecting up to 5 music genres.

Spotify gives each song a popularity score from 0 - 100 based on an algorithm that uses the number of times a song is played and how recently it was played.
